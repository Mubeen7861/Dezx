**what currently exists?**
The agent has successfully scaffolded a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.

*   **Backend:** All required MongoDB models (, , , , , , , , ) have been created. The main  file includes API routes for authentication and CRUD operations for most of these models. A mock file upload utility that saves files locally has been implemented.
*   **Frontend:** A large number of React components for pages have been created, covering the landing page, authentication, public listings, and dashboards for all three user roles (designer, client, superadmin). The application routing is set up in , and an API client exists in . Base styling to match the design requirements has been applied.
*   **Data:** A  script was created and successfully executed, populating the database with test users, projects, competitions, and site content.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was implementing the GOD MODE Super Admin panel. It just finished creating the frontend page components for the Notifications page (), Admin Settings (), and Admin Audit Logs (). The next logical step was to integrate these new pages into the application's routing and navigation.
*   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done**: N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?**: both
*   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1**: API routes require a trailing slash to work correctly.
*   **Issue 2**: File uploads are mocked and use local storage instead of Cloudinary.

**Issues Detail**:
*   **Issue 1**:
    *   **Attempted fixes**: The agent patched the frontend API client () to append a trailing slash to every request. This is a temporary workaround, not a robust solution.
    *   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Review the  and  app instantiation in .
        2.  Ensure that the router configuration correctly handles requests with and without trailing slashes, as FastAPI should do by default. The current behavior suggests a misconfiguration.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Fixing this in the backend will make the API more robust and adhere to standard REST practices, removing the need for a client-side hack.
    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: backend
    *   **Blocked on other issue**: None
*   **Issue 2**:
    *   **Attempted fixes**: A mock upload utility was created at  as requested by the user.
    *   **Next debug checklist**: This is not a bug but a planned limitation. The task is to replace the mock utility with a real Cloudinary implementation.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To enable persistent, cloud-based file storage for production use.
    *   **Status**: BLOCKED
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
    *   **Blocked on other issue**: Blocked on user providing Cloudinary API keys.

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1**: Complete Super Admin Panel & Full Feature Implementation.

**Task Detail**:
*   **Task 1**:
    *   **Where to resume**:
        1.  Modify  to add the new routes for , , and .
        2.  Update the admin sidebar in  to include navigation links to these new pages.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?**: This will complete the UI scaffolding for the new admin and notification features, making them accessible within the application.
    *   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
    *   **Blocked on something**: None

**changes in tech stack**
*   The project uses a **FastAPI + React** stack, which differs from the user's initial request for Next.js. The user explicitly approved this change.

**All files of reference**
*   : The core backend application containing all API logic.
*   : The root of the frontend application, defining all routes.
*   : The centralized module for making API calls from the frontend.
*   : Directory containing all database model definitions.
*   : The script used for populating the database with initial test data.
*   : The layout for user dashboards, which needs to be updated.
*   : A summary of the project requirements and progress.
*   : AI-generated design guidelines that informed the UI.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   The API client's trailing slash workaround () should be removed once the root cause in the FastAPI backend is fixed.

**key api endpoints**
*   **/api/auth/**: Routes for user registration, login, and session management.
*   **/api/content/**: Endpoint to fetch dynamic content for the landing page.
*   **/api/projects/**: CRUD endpoints for freelance projects.
*   **/api/competitions/**: CRUD endpoints for design competitions.
*   **/api/proposals/**: Endpoints for submitting and managing proposals.
*   **/api/submissions/**: Endpoints for submitting and managing competition entries.
*   **/api/admin/**: Routes for the super admin panel (user management, settings, logs).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   **Tech Stack Change**: Remember, this project uses **FastAPI + React**, not Next.js.
*   **File Uploads are MOCKED**: Do not attempt to use Cloudinary. The current implementation saves files to the local filesystem as a placeholder. This functionality is blocked until the user provides API keys.
*   **Trailing Slash Issue**: The backend API currently requires trailing slashes on requests. A temporary fix exists in the frontend API client. The proper solution is to fix the router configuration in .
*   **Resume Point**: Your immediate task is to continue the implementation of the Super Admin panel by adding the newly created pages (, , ) to the main router in  and the admin sidebar navigation in .

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
The user provided two large prompts detailing the full requirements for the Freelance module, Competition module, a GOD MODE Super Admin panel, and a full notification system. The agent has started implementing these features. There are no pending messages from the user.

**Project Health Check:**
*   **Broken**: API routing has a known flaw regarding trailing slashes, which is currently handled by a client-side workaround.
*   **Mocked**: The entire file upload system (for project attachments, competition submissions, etc.) is mocked to use local storage.

**3rd Party Integrations**
*   **Cloudinary**: Planned for file uploads, but not yet integrated. The implementation is currently mocked. Requires User API Key.

**Testing status**
*   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: NO
*   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
*   **Test files created**: []
*   **Known regressions**: None known, but testing has been minimal.

**Credentials to test flow:**
*   **Super Admin**:  / 
*   **Designer**:  / 
*   **Client**:  / 

**What agent forgot to execute**
*   The agent did not run the  after the initial MVP build, despite its own plan to do so. It encountered an error with the test agent and pivoted to manual testing instead of debugging the failure.
*   The agent has not yet created the  file as requested in the user's final prompt.
*   The agent has not yet implemented UI refinements like skeleton loaders and confirmation modals.
*   The agent's immediate next step should be updating the admin navigation sidebar in , which it has not yet done after creating the new admin pages.</analysis>
